# g-tensor

Calculation of G-tensor

 - "ras_h2o.inp": QChem output used as input in the programs
 - "g_main.py": main prorgam that uses "g_read.py" and "g_operations.py" in order to write the spin (sigma) and orbital (lambda) angular momentums with the g-factor results
 - "g_read.py": read the needed variables from "ras_h2o.inp" 
 - "g_operations.py": makes the operations needed in each step calculation
